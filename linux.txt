### Administration ###

    Create a new user:
        adduser myusername

    Passwordless sudo:
        visudo; "%sudo         ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"

        usermod -a -G groupname username
            usermod -a -G sudo keeton

    List a user's groups:
        groups
        groups [username]

    Install from a .deb file
        https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159094/how-to-install-a-deb-file-by-dpkg-i-or-by-apt
            Install: dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file

          You can find the PID of a running process with 'ps aux | grep [process]'

    Remove the password from a ssh key:
      ssh-keygen -p
        You will be prompted for the key's current password

    Allocate addition swap space. Good for Composer's high memory requirement when you're on a virtual machine.
      Be careful with the 'dd' command!
      From: https://coderwall.com/p/grhteq/when-composer-cannot-allocate-memory
        sudo /bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap.1 bs=1M count=1024
        sudo /sbin/mkswap /var/swap.1
        sudo /sbin/swapon /var/swap.1

    Get the current debian version:
      lsb_release -a
      cat /etc/issue
      cat /etc/debian_version
      cat /etc/os-release

    Did you know that Debian ships with an active firewall?
      Open a port:
        ufw allow [port]

    iptables
        Example add rule:

    Tar a directory:
        tar -zcvf filename.tar.gz /target/directory

    Extract a .tar file
        tar -xvf file.tar

    Extract a .tar.gz file
        tar -xvzf file.tar.gz

    Rename with regex:
        rename
            rename 's/text_to_find/replace_with/' *.txt

    List only subdirectories from the current directory:
        ls -d */

    List files, but don't organize them. Much faster.
        ls -U

    List the most recently modified files in a readable format (using the power of the gods)
        ls -thor

    Find large directories
         du -hsx * | sort -rh | head -10 #human readable, current directory

    Test if a file exists
        test -f file.txt OR [ -f file.txt ]
        test -f file.txt && echo 'File Exists'

    Prepend text to a file. Opposite of >>
        echo -e "data1\ndata2\n$(cat file.txt)" > file.txt

### Shell ###

    Show command history
        history

    Reverse search through history:
        <ctlr>-R

    Go back to the previous directory:
        cd -

    Copy files including hidden files like .gitignore
        cp *.* DOES NOT WORK. Use rsync instead
            rsync -av . /path/to/target

    Repeat your last command:
        !!
            sudo !!

    Insert the arguments from your last bash command into your current bash command:
        <alt>-.

    Set an ENVIRONMENT variable:
        export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano #sets the default editor to nano

    View all ENVIRONMENT variables:
        export -p

    Manipulate your $PATH
        View current $PATH
            echo $PATH
        Add a directory to your $PATH
            export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
                - Valid only for the current session. You need to make the change in your shell config file (~/.bashrc; ~/.zshrc).
        Read the new shell config file to update saved variables:
            source ~/.bashrc 

    Create an alias:
        alias [id]='[command to alias]'

    List aliases:
        alias

    Execute a remote command via ssh:
        ssh user@host [command1];[command2]
            ssh keeton@server.com date;who;df -h

    Make the speaker beep; make a noise:
        echo -e '\a'

### Devices ###

    Get system information
        dmidecode -t system

    Make a hard drive enclosure blink. Essentially, this command attempts to copy from the source disk to the garbage can. This process will trigger your enclosure LED to blink continuously.

    List available disk devices
        fdisk -l
        lsblk -f

    List available USB devices
        lsusb

    List available block devices to determine physical location
        lsblk -o HCTL,MODEL,PATH,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,MOUNTPOINTS,TYPE,VENDOR

    Mount all drives listed under /etc/fstab (if you make a change and don't want to reboot)
        mount -a

    Mount an .iso disk image
        mount -o loop my_disk.iso /mnt/iso

    Wipe a drive
        wipefs -a /dev/sdX

    Show timezone
        date +%Z

    Change output format
        date +'%d/%m/%Y  %H:%M:%S [%:z  %Z]'

    Adjust the system time to a different timezone (temporarily set the timezone variable for a command)
    i.e. What's the current time in a different timezone?
        TZ=America/New_York date;
        TZ=America/Chicago date;
        TZ=America/Los_Angeles date;

    For arithmetic
        date -d "+5 hours"

    It's 6pm in Taipei, what time is it here?
        date --date='TZ="Asia/Taipei" 18:00'
