I added a script in /usr/lib/update_sender_access for this task. If the incoming address is in the sender_access list specifically, it should bypass spam checking.


#Bypass spam checking (amavis) by sender or domain
  Add domain or sender address to
    /etc/amavis/whitelist
      test@example.com
      example.com
  Restart amavis
    /etc/init.d/amavis restart
  Sender/domain will bypass spam check and receive WHITELISTED header tag
