- Change location of the repository using the "switch" command, not "relocate" which is unavailable in earlier versions of Subversion
    svn switch --relocate FROM TO
        svn switch --relocate https://secure.danifer.com/svn/rightinvoice.com/trunk svn+altssh://dfw2.danifer.com/home/svn/rightinvoice.com/trunk

- Export a repository to remove it from version control
    svn export [source] [destination]
        - note: will not export untracked files, so you need to move things that aren't under version control manually (stored data files, .pdfs, etc.).
